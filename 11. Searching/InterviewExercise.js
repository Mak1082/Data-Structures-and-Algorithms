//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
BFS

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
BFS(DFS will take a very long time)

//If the tree is very wide:
DFS(BFS will take too much memory)

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
DFS

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
DFS

//Finding the shortest path:
BFS

BFS - Breadth First Search
DFS - Depth First Search

You can use any one as long as you can explain to the interviewer that why you are using that.
He just needs to know that you know what you're talking about.
